# Chapter 5: Responsive Styling with Bootstrap

## Objectives
* Use Grid System to lay out the content that fluidly resizes on all the
* devices.  
* Lay out the 3 rows to display 3 equal width columns on large display.
* Make the layout 2 columns on a med width display.
* The content stacks to a single column layout on small display.

## Steps

1. Create a `WIP/bootstrap` directory.

1. In this directory, locate the `starterTemplate.html` file and copy this file into the new WIP/bootstrap directory. Right-click to rename the file as `grid.html`.

1. Open this `grid.html` int he browser to see how it displays 3 breeds of dogs. 

1. Modify the `grid.html` file to use Bootstrap classes. The outermost div is the container, then row, then column sizes are specified for different screen sizes. 
    ```html
    <div class="container">
            <div class="row">
                <div class="col-xs-12 col-sm-6 col-md-4">
    ```                     


1. Now, reload this file in the browser and change the size of the browser window. It should be responive to screen size changes.

1. Mark your work as complete.
