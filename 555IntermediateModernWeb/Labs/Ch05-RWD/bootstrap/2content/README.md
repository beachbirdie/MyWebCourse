# Chapter 5: Responsive Styling with Bootstrap

## Objectives
* Add images to the previous exercise.

## Steps

1.  In this directory, locate the `img` directory and copy this directory into the WIP/bootstrap directory. 

1. In this `WIP/bootstrap`, continue working on previous file `grid.html`. 

1. If not finished in last exercise, then copy the `grid.html` from the `Labs/bootstrap/1layout/Solution/` folder.

1. Add images for each dog, one to follow each existing `<h2>` element. Do this for all 3 dogs. An example:
    ```html
    <h2>Pembroke Welsh Corgi</h2>
    <img src="img/corgi.jpg" alt="Pembroke Welsh Corgi" />
    ```

1. Reload the browser. And resize the page to see how the default use of `<img />` works.

1. Now use Bootstrap to make the images responsive. Add a class with img-fluid. Experiment by using: img-thumbnail,         
    rounded-circle, and rounded.

    ```html
        <img src="img/corgi.jpg" alt="Pembroke Welsh Corgi" class="img-fluid img-thumbnail">
    ```

1. Reload the browser to see new styling for images. Resize the page to see how the images respond after havign added Bootstrap. 

1. Mark your work as complete, before starting the bonus.
